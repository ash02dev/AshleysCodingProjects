I need to build a fullstack web application using java, javascript, html, and css. The application is a task management system and needs to allow the user to add tasks to a calendar, delete the tasks, mark tasks as complete, and move tasks to a new date or time on the calendar. The UI should show a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly view all at once. The user should be able to drag tasks from one date on the calendar to another date on the calendar. Any tasks that are not assigned a date on the calendar should be in a "To Complete" section on a side panel. 


Building a full-stack web application with Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a task management system with the features you described would require a more complex setup involving both front-end and back-end development. Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. Set up the back-end:
   - Use Java to build the server-side of the application.
   - Choose a web framework like Spring Boot or Java Servlets to handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - Implement RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for tasks and their properties (such as date, time, completion status).
   - Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store task data. Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool like Hibernate or JPA to interact with the database.

2. Implement the front-end:
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface.
   - Create different views (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) using HTML and CSS. Use CSS Grid or a UI framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for layout and responsiveness.
   - Use JavaScript to handle interactions and dynamic behavior of the UI components.
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality using JavaScript libraries like interact.js or a UI framework with built-in drag-and-drop support.
   - Use JavaScript to send requests to the back-end APIs (created in step 1) and update the UI based on the server responses.

3. Integrate front-end and back-end:
   - Use AJAX or fetch API in JavaScript to make HTTP requests to the back-end APIs and retrieve task data.
   - Implement event listeners and handlers in JavaScript to handle user interactions and update the server with changes made to tasks (e.g., moving tasks to a new date/time, marking tasks as complete).
   - Update the UI dynamically based on the responses from the back-end APIs.

4. Implement the "To Complete" section:
   - Design and implement a side panel in the UI to display tasks that are not assigned a date on the calendar.
   - Use JavaScript to filter and display these tasks separately from the calendar view.
   - Implement functionality to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete for the "To Complete" section.

It's important to note that building a complete task management system with all the described features can be a complex and time-consuming process. It may involve additional considerations like authentication, user registration, and data validation. Additionally, you may need to explore and use appropriate libraries, frameworks, or UI components depending on your specific requirements and preferences.
